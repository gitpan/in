NAME

    in - provides the in operator as a replacement for smartmatch

VERSION

    version 0.0001

SYNOPSIS

        use in;
    
        my $found = 42 |in| [ 1 .. 100 ];

DESCRIPTION

    This modules imports the in operator. It can be used in three
    equivalent forms:

        $foo |in| $bar
        $foo /in/ $bar
        $foo <<in>> $bar

    It does a simplified version of smartmatch. This module is just a thin
    wrapper around the match function from match::simple. See its
    documentation for more details.
